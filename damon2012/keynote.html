Emerging, fast non-volatile memories are around 1000s of times faster than conventional disks in terms of latency, and they offer enormous gains in bandwidth as well.   I'll survey the current efforts to re-engineer systems to take advantage of this increased storage performance, including new architectures, programming models, and approaches to storage management.  Based on our experience to date, it is clear that leveraging these new technologies requires significant and disruptive changes across many of the hardware and software components, many of which are not traditionally thought of as part of the storage system.  The full extent of these changes, much less what they should be, is not yet clear, but it is very clear that without those changes it will difficult to make the case for wide-scale adoption of these technologies.  I'll also share my lab's experience in exploring this areas and sketch out some future directions that look promising.

<b>Bio</b>: 

Steven Swanson is an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of California, San Diego and the director of the Non-volatile Systems Laboratory.  His research interests include the systems, architecture, security, and reliability issues surrounding non-volatile, solid-state memories.  He also co-leads projects to develop low-power co-processors for irregular applications and to devise software techniques for using multiple processors to speed up single-threaded computations.  In previous lives he has worked on scalable dataflow architectures, ubiquitous computing, and simultaneous multithreading.  He received his PhD from the University of Washington in 2006.
